Hello! I am Masato Terai (assistant professor) from Aichi University of Technology.

This repository contains materials for a lecture in the Humanities Department of the Graduate School at Nagoya University (2025/04 - ).

The contents are likely to be updated without notice, as this is my first year teaching this course. Until each lecture has been given, all materials should be considered as being in a preparatory stage. As a result, some parts may be disorganized.
